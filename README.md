# dcs211_final_liambaron5_areed296
Included in the github repo are all of the files involved in attempting to create a spotify integrated track data program. The working program is all concentrated in dcs211_f2025_finalproject_lbaron/MusicAnalysis/
This version does not use spotipy and only uses os, librosa and numpy and is called analyze_music.py
os is preinstalled with python so the program can import os itself
librosa must be installed with "pip install librosa" in terminal for it to be used
numpy must also be installed with "pip install numpy" in terminal for it to be used 

In order to use the program open terminal and navigate to the MusicAnalysis directory.
Next you can python3 analyze_music.py to run the program.
This will scan the folder called audio_files for .mp3 and .wav files.
Use the selection prompt in terminal to select the song you would like to analyze.
Wait a few moments and results will be displayed in terminal.
